                <p>
                    Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.

                <p>
                    Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. ... Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.

                <p>
                    Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, or vegetables. A sushi roll is shaped inside a thin sheet of seaweed. Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most Americans think of it as raw fish.
